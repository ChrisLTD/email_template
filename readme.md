# Chris Johnson's Email Template
### Version 1.0.0 | By [Chris Johnson](http://chrisltd.com) | https://github.com/ChrisLTD/email_template

This is the project template I start with when creating new HTML email. It uses Gulp Connect for live reloading during development.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install yarn through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew install yarn
```

### 2. Install node:

```
yarn install
```

### 3. Run Gulp to watch your changes and launch a server with live reload:
```
yarn dev
```
